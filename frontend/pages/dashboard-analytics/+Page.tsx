        <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          The body map shows a heatmap of your weekly volume per muscle group. The key difference from basic app heatmaps: <strong>these are rolling 7-day windows</strong>, which matches how your body actually recovers, not arbitrary calendar weeks.
        </p>
        <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Hover any muscle to see your weekly set rate, current volume zone (maintenance, growth, or overreaching), and estimated progress %. Click a muscle to drill into exactly which exercises contribute, with primary and secondary involvement weighted separately.
        </p>
        <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          A &ldquo;top 3 concentration&rdquo; metric warns you if too much volume is concentrated in a few muscles. Green = well-distributed. Red = you might be neglecting something.

          <li><strong>Getting stronger</strong> — Clear positive trend (&gt; +1% strength change).</li>

          <li><strong>Gold PRs</strong> — True all-time bests for weight, 1RM estimate, and volume.</li>
          <li><strong>Silver PRs</strong> — Best in the last 2 months. Important for experienced lifters who rarely hit true all-time PRs.</li>
          <li><strong>Premature PRs</strong> — A big spike that wasn&rsquo;t sustained in follow-up sessions. Flagged so you know it wasn&rsquo;t a real breakthrough yet.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          It also tracks <strong>PR droughts</strong> (days since last all-time PR) and <strong>PR frequency</strong> (new PRs per week). The dashboard summary tells you if your momentum is heating up or cooling off.

          FitVerse can export your full training history in a structured format designed for AI analysis. You pick a timeframe (last session, 1/3/6 months, or all data), optionally select analysis modules (junk volume audit, structural balance, joint health check, intensity drift, etc.), and it generates a prompt + clipboard-ready data. Paste into any AI and ask anything.
        </p>
        <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          The built-in modules cover: comprehensive audit, redundancy check, junk volume audit, intensity drift, structural balance, fatigue correlation, joint health, and unilateral balance. Or write your own custom prompt.

        This is simple but powerful. Pick any date range, a single day, a week, a month, a year, or multiple custom ranges, and <strong>every chart, every metric, every insight recalculates</strong> for just that window. Compare your 2025 training against 2024 in seconds. Isolate a specific training block and see what changed.

        <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Flex cards are shareable year-in-review summaries: total volume lifted (with fun real-world comparisons), best month, longest streak, top exercises, muscle balance, and total PRs. Designed to look good when shared.

Uses a diminishing-returns formula so early milestones feel achievable and late tiers require real dedication.
