          Most apps show a basic body map or a list of exercises grouped by day. None of them tell you: <strong>&ldquo;You train chest 3x more than back.&rdquo;</strong>

        <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          FitVerse&rsquo;s interactive muscle heatmap uses rolling 7-day windows to match real recovery patterns. Click any muscle to see exactly which exercises contribute. Primary and secondary muscle involvement is weighted separately. You get a weekly sets-per-muscle breakdown with volume zone scoring (maintenance, growth, or overreaching) personalized to your training age.

          Your app might show a line chart of your bench press over time. But it won&rsquo;t tell you if you&rsquo;re plateauing, regressing, or making real progress, and it certainly won&rsquo;t tell you <em>what to do about it</em>.

        <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          FitVerse labels every exercise with a clear status: <strong>Getting stronger, Plateauing, Taking a dip,</strong> or <strong>New.</strong> When you&rsquo;re stuck, you get a tiny actionable suggestion: &ldquo;add 1 rep to your first set&rdquo; or &ldquo;bump the weight 2.5 kg.&rdquo; It also detects premature PRs (big jumps you couldn&rsquo;t sustain) and PR droughts (no new best in over 2 weeks).

          Your logging app shows sets and reps. It doesn&rsquo;t tell you that your third set dropped too fast, or that your weight jump was premature, or that your back-off set was an effective way to add volume.

          FitVerse gives <strong>set-by-set coaching feedback</strong> across 19 scenarios. Each set gets a short badge (&ldquo;Normal Fatigue,&rdquo; &ldquo;Too Aggressive,&rdquo; &ldquo;Good Reset&rdquo;) and a tooltip with exact numbers. Beginners learn how to progress faster. Experienced lifters spot patterns they&rsquo;d miss.
